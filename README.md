#   Currency Converter Web Application

##  Project Description

The **Currency Converter Web Application** is a responsive and interactive frontend project developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to convert currency values between different countries in real time by fetching accurate exchange rates from a third-party **Currency Exchange API**. The application emphasizes simplicity, reliability, and smooth user interaction, making currency conversion fast and easy.

##  Features

* Real-time currency conversion
* Selection of source and target currencies
* Live exchange rate display
* Instant results without page reload
* Clean and intuitive user interface
* Fully responsive design for all devices

##  Technologies Used

* **HTML** – Application structure
* **CSS** – Styling and responsive layout
* **JavaScript** – Logic, API integration, and DOM manipulation
* **Currency Exchange API** – Real-time exchange rate data


##  API Integration

The application integrates a third-party **Currency Converter API** to retrieve live exchange rates. JavaScript’s `fetch()` method is used to make asynchronous API requests and dynamically update the UI based on the user’s selected currencies.


##  How It Works

1. The user enters the amount to be converted.
2. The user selects the **From** currency.
3. The user selects the **To** currency.
4. The **Get Exchange Rate** button is clicked.
5. The application fetches the latest exchange rate from the API.
6. The converted amount and exchange rate are displayed instantly.


##  How to Run the Project

1. Open the project folder.
2. Run `index.html` in a modern web browser.
3. Ensure an active internet connection for API access.

##  Learning Outcomes

* API integration using JavaScript
* Asynchronous programming with `fetch()`
* DOM manipulation and event handling
* Responsive web design practices
* Real-world frontend project development


##  Future Enhancements

* Currency conversion history
* Dark mode interface
* Enhanced error handling
* Auto-detect user location currency
* UI animations and transitions
